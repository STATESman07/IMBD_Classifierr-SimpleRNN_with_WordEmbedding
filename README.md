# SimpleRNN-imbdClassifire
This project demonstrates a text classification pipeline using SimpleRNN and Word Embedding layers to predict sentiment (positive or negative) on the IMDB movie review dataset. Built using TensorFlow, the project also includes model tracking with TensorBoard and a GUI for prediction using Streamlit.
